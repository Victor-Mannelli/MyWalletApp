Hello! Welcome to the readme of "My Wallet App - FrontEnd"

This repo is the FrontEnd of my first full stack project.
There is another repo in my github page which is the BackEnd Project that makes all the connections to the mongo databases acessed in this project.

In this project you can create an account, log in, add all money transactions you make and show them on the receipt page, where you have a list of all of them with representations of expenses (money spent) or entrances (money received), with a display in the bottom showing the final amount.

This project was done while studying Full Stack Development in Driven Education. It was the first full stack project but also the fist to have almost no mandatory requirements besides using specifics tools in the BackEnd like mongodb, express, joi and cors.

Thanks for the attention, if you have time checkout my others projects!
